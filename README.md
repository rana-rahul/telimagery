**NOTE: This repository is still in draft mode and not ready for public use. Please feel free however, to check out the code and references below as this repository matures.**

Telimagery is a Python library to process and analyze imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data.

IMC is an expansion of mass cytometry (MC), a high-throughput technology capable of powerful multiplexing to interrogate heterogenous cell samples. IMC relies on the same method of detection as MC to analyze immunohistochemical and immunocytological samples with sub-cellular resolution.
